This project was originally create using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was then migrated to [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) following [these steps](https://darekkay.com/blog/create-react-app-to-vite/).

## Available NPM Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:6502](http://localhost:6502) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## VS Code Chrome Debugging

Stop all running Chrome instances and then:

`/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222`

Use `npm start` to start the running instance.

In launch.json, add a launch configuration:

```json
    {
      "name": "Attach to Chrome",
      "port": 9222,
      "request": "attach",
      "type": "chrome",
      "url": "http://localhost:6502",
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
    },

```

## Android Chrome Debugging

Using Android Studio, create a new device (like a phone), start the device.

Start the emulator with `npm run host` to make the application available to the network. You must do this - you cannot run on `localhost:6502` or `10.0.2.2:6502` on Android (it's some conflict with vite and chrome).

Navigate to the provided URL - it will be something like `10.0.0.xxx:6502`.

On your Desktop Chrome, go to `chrome://inspect/#devices` and then choose the appropriate "Remote Target".

## iOS Debugging

## Jest Test Debugging in VS Code

In VS Code, add breakpoints to the test code. Then open up `package.json`, hover over
the "test" script, and select 'Debug Script'.

## Localhost Certificates

Gamepads will only work with a secure (https) context.
To enable https when running from localhost, you need to [generate a
certificate](https://flaviocopes.com/react-how-to-configure-https-localhost/)
and [install it on your system](https://flaviocopes.com/macos-install-ssl-local/).

## Apple II ROMs

This repository doesn't contain any Apple II ROMs. However, these are fairly easy to find on the web.
To make a ROM image, save the raw binary data from the C000-FFFF ROM in a single file.
Then convert the file to a Base64 encoding. On the Mac, I used the following command:

```sh
    openssl base64 -in rom_2e.bin -out rom_2e.base64.ts
```

Finally, edit the `.ts` file, and change the file to be an exported string variable by prepending:

```ts
    export const rom=`
```

Don't forget to append the trailing back quote ` at the end of the file.
