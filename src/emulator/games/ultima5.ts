For MIDI Support:
1) Launch a WebMIDI supported player (such as https://signal.vercel.app/) in a separate tab, and leave it running.  Make sure its WebMIDI support is enabled.
2) In U5, Go to Activate Music -> Change Music Configuration, add Passport to slot 2, and hit enter. 
3) In the Midi Information screen, select Channel 1 (default), 16 voices, and then enter the numbers 1-15 for "Midi Number" in each song (where Ultima Theme is '1' and Rule Britannia is '15'). Then hit enter on each song to test.
